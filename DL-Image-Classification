Image Classification Challenge:
In this team-based challenge, we developed a deep learning model to classify images into 7 distinct dinosaur species. This project is part of the 'Artificial Intelligence' course at Thomas More, and focuses on applying TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
Challenge Overview:
The dataset includes images of various dinosaur species, and your goal is to classify them into the following categories:

Requirements:
Jupyter Notebook: Structure your notebook with markdown cells to document your process. This will help in the defense of your solution, so make sure you explain your reasoning behind each step.
Model Development: Use TensorFlow/Keras (no PyTorch or other deep learning frameworks) for building and training your model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to uncover key insights that will guide your model-building process.
Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques using Keras to improve model generalization.
Transfer Learning: Implement transfer learning by leveraging pre-trained models to enhance your model’s performance.
Training Visualization: Plot the training and validation error over time to track model performance.
Model Evaluation: Use a confusion matrix to evaluate your model’s classification performance.
